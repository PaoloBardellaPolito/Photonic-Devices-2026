## Purpose

The notebook is intended to connect the analytical description of an all-pass ring resonator with its spectral response.

Interactive controls make it possible to investigate how the resonator behavior changes with:

- field self-coupling coefficient \(t\);
- ring round-trip length \(L\);
- waveguide propagation loss;
- effective refractive index \(n_{\mathrm{eff}}\);
- group index \(n_g\);
- reference wavelength \(\lambda_0\).

A dedicated control can also impose the **critical-coupling condition** automatically.

## Model

The round-trip propagation factor is

\[
p(\lambda)=a\,e^{-j\phi(\lambda)},
\]

where \(a\) is the round-trip field attenuation and

\[
\phi(\lambda)=\beta(\lambda)L,
\qquad
\beta(\lambda)=\frac{2\pi n_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)}{\lambda}.
\]

The all-pass transfer function is

\[
H(\lambda)=\frac{t-p(\lambda)}
{1-t\,p(\lambda)}.
\]

The displayed power transmission is

\[
T(\lambda)=|H(\lambda)|^2.
\]

## Linearized dispersion model

The wavelength dependence of the effective index is approximated around the reference wavelength \(\lambda_0\) by

\[
n_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)
\simeq
n_{\mathrm{eff},0}
+
\left.
\frac{d n_{\mathrm{eff}}}{d\lambda}
\right|_{\lambda_0}
(\lambda-\lambda_0).
\]

Using

\[
n_g
=
n_{\mathrm{eff}}
-
\lambda
\frac{d n_{\mathrm{eff}}}{d\lambda},
\]

the slope is obtained directly from the specified values of \(n_{\mathrm{eff},0}\) and \(n_g\):

\[
\left.
\frac{d n_{\mathrm{eff}}}{d\lambda}
\right|_{\lambda_0}
=
\frac{n_{\mathrm{eff},0}-n_g}{\lambda_0}.
\]

This simple model allows \(n_{\mathrm{eff}}\) to determine the absolute resonance positions while \(n_g\) controls, to first order, the resonance spacing.

## Loss model

The propagation loss is specified as a **power loss in dB/cm**.

For a round-trip length \(L\), the corresponding field attenuation is

\[
a=
10^{-\alpha_{\mathrm{dB/cm}}L_{\mathrm{cm}}/20}.
\]

For an ideal lossless directional coupler, the cross-coupling amplitude is

\[
\kappa=\sqrt{1-t^2}.
\]

## Quantities calculated by the notebook

For every choice of parameters, the notebook evaluates and displays:

- round-trip length and equivalent ring radius;
- round-trip amplitude attenuation \(a\);
- self-coupling coefficient \(t\);
- cross-coupling coefficient \(\kappa\);
- coupling regime: undercoupled, critically coupled, or overcoupled;
- resonance order and nearest resonance wavelength;
- free spectral range in frequency and wavelength;
- resonance FWHM;
- finesse;
- quality factor \(Q\);
- transmission at resonance.

The approximate free spectral range is

\[
\mathrm{FSR}_f
\simeq
\frac{c}{n_g L},
\]

or, in wavelength,

\[
\mathrm{FSR}_\lambda
\simeq
\frac{\lambda_r^2}{n_g L}.
\]

For a sufficiently narrow resonance, the wavelength FWHM is estimated as

\[
\Delta\lambda_{\mathrm{FWHM}}
\simeq
\mathrm{FSR}_\lambda
\frac{1-ta}{\pi\sqrt{ta}},
\]

and

\[
Q=
\frac{\lambda_r}
{\Delta\lambda_{\mathrm{FWHM}}}.
\]

## Interactive exploration

The sliders can be used to examine several important physical effects.

### Ring size and FSR

Increasing the round-trip length decreases the free spectral range:

\[
L\uparrow
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\mathrm{FSR}\downarrow.
\]

### Coupling regimes

The relation between \(t\) and \(a\) determines the coupling regime:

- \(t>a\): undercoupled;
- \(t=a\): critical coupling;
- \(t<a\): overcoupled.

At critical coupling, the through-port transmission ideally vanishes at resonance.

### Effective index and group index

Changing \(n_{\mathrm{eff}}\) mainly shifts the absolute resonance positions, while changing \(n_g\) changes the FSR.

### Propagation loss

Increasing propagation loss reduces the round-trip amplitude \(a\), changes the critical-coupling condition, and modifies the resonance linewidth and quality factor.

## Output plots

The notebook produces:

1. **Power transmission versus wavelength**, showing the periodic resonances of the all-pass ring.
2. **Phase of the transfer function versus wavelength**, showing the rapid phase variation close to resonance.

The wavelength window is automatically adapted to the FSR so that several resonances remain visible when the ring parameters are changed.

## Running the notebook

The easiest option is to open the notebook directly in **Google Colab** using the link above.

The notebook uses only standard scientific Python packages:

```text
numpy
matplotlib
ipywidgets
```

No local installation is required when using Colab.

## Course context

This notebook accompanies the discussion of directional couplers and microring resonators in the **Photonic Devices 2026** course.

It is intended as an interactive educational model rather than as a full electromagnetic simulator. In particular, the coupler is represented by wavelength-independent coefficients and the waveguide dispersion is described using a first-order model around \(\lambda_0\).
